iimenu.sh:
	- this relies on dmenu (http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu)
	- server directories are assumed to exist in your /tmp
	- press escape to exit
iiview.sh
	- somewhat buggy
	- scrolling does not work (though 'b' can pass in a pinch
	- written in ksh93, rather than portable POSIX sh
	- I honestly don't know what a good chunk of this code is doing
